See detailed instructions for this homework assignment [here](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/homework/text-analysis/). The data (text) used for this assignment were from the `gutenbergr` package.

## Required packages

The following packages were used:

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(gutenbergr)

```

## Files included

The following files were included in this repository:

* [lesmiz.Rmd](lesmiz.Rmd) - sentiment analysis of Les Mis√©rables text
* [lesmiz.md](lesmiz.md) - the output of sentiment analysis
* [lesmiz_files](lesmiz_files) - the graphs generated in the Rmd file
* [deh.Rmd](deh.Rmd) - my (failed) attempt at downloading the lyrics of Dear Evan Hansen; this has nothing to do with my homework analysis, but I decided to include it anyways because I spent so much time on it
